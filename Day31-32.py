# Sets 

# Set is a collection of distinct objects or values 

new_set = {1,3,4,5,6,3}

print(new_set)

# it doesn't maintain order of the values  

ariha = {}

print(type(ariha)) #its giving type dictionary 

# because the syntax of writing set and dictionary is same 

# if you want to create an empty set you will write it as 

new = set()

print(type(new))


# Methods in set for its manipulation
